# ESP32-4Motors-Robot-with-PS4-Remote-Control
This project implements a robot control system using ESP32 and four motors. It uses the Bluepad32 library to connect and read inputs from a PS4 controller. The robot moves forward, backward, turns smoothly, and spins in place based on joystick and button inputs. Motor speeds are controlled via PWM with calibration for balanced movement.
